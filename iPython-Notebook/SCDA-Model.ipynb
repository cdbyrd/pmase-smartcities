    "There is a trend for municipal governments to move past providing basic services and enter the realm of Smart Cities projects.  The motivation behind this trend is twofold.  One motivation is the financial benefits for the municipality.  With a successful and targeted technology implementation it is possible to drastically reduce the ongoing maintenance and operational costs of specific municipal activities.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The second motivation is public perception of constituents in the municipality.  Citizens in a region drive the workforce.   Historically the average US worker was relatively stationary around a specific area.  However, modern generations are more willing to relocate to areas where quality jobs and a high quality of life are available.   This introduces competition among municipalities for advanced and highly paid workforce members.   These members tend to attract larger employers, and tend to be a driver for higher tax revenue for the municipality.   In order to compete in this workforce marketplace, municipalities are looking for ways to attract employers, jobs, and citizens.   Smart Cities projects are one mechanism employed to differentiate a municipality for the purpose of attracting and retaining this targeted workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "A goal of this document is to define the current state of decision making for municipal entities within the context of Smart Cities project evaluation.   The current state is evaluated to understand the process and identify gaps between the current and ideal process for project evaluation.   Finally, a recommendation is provided as to how a proposed Smart Cities Decision Aid (SCDA) modeling tool can better assist a municipality with the decisions and evaluation tasks involved with Smart Cities project evaluation to meet the objectives of reduced operational costs, increased revenue opportunities, and increased public perception.

    "# Need Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Municipal governments currently have limited access to rigorous and quantifiable Systems Engineering methods to evaluate costs and benefits of proposed Smart Cities infrastructure technology projects.  The current process involves informal qualitative project evaluation, which leads to sub-optimal technical, planning, and spending decisions for the municipality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling and simulation can be employed to improve the decision making process around Smart City projects, enabling virtual exploration of several technology solutions with minimal upfront capital investment.   This exploration can provide a much more stable foundation evaluating specific technology investments and validating alignment with municipal master plans.   The SCDA tool attempts to provide this modeling capability to improve the Smart City infrastructure project evaluation and selection process for municipal governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA program aims to accomplish the following objectives for an engaged municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide ability to evaluate municipality Smart City project _objectives, constraints, and preferences_.\n",
    "1. Provide ability to evaluate Smart City project proposals on _municipal revenue_ and _public perception_ benefits.\n",
    "1. Assist the municipality to analyze and optimize Smart City project decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The success of the SCDA program is largely associated with how well objectives, constraints, and preferences of the municipality can be extracted and quantified for use in later modeling and simulation activities.  Proper understanding of these inputs has a profound impact on the quality and validity of derived results from the SCDA tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional success criteria for the SCDA program is the proper association of effectivness of a project to a quantifiable measure of utility.   The goal of the SCDA program is to represent benefits in constant financial terms.  In some cases this involves interpreting public perception to a financial term for model evaluation.  The success of the evaluation and proper interpretation of utility measurements will impact the effectiveness of the SCDA tool.  Program validation will focus on the consistency and accuracy of the utility measurement to ensure operational effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customer Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers of the SCDA program are municipalities attempting to evaluate the costs and benefits of various Smart Cities project proposals.  The main problem faced by municipalities today is that they may not possess a quantifiable way to evaluate project options and understand the risks, costs, and benefits involved with a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lacking the ability to compare projects quantifiably, a municipality currently qualitatively compares project proposals to identify candidates for further evaluation.  In many cases the evaluation of a large project involves a pilot implementation that may or may not provide an accurate representation of the final deployment state.  The SCDA project attempts to address this customer need by providing a method to quantifiably evaluate and compare Smart Cities projects, without large upfront capital investments, and reduce the over reliance on pilot programs for project selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA tool should perform the following capabilities to address the operational objectives of the SCDA project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide ability for municipalities to effectively communicate objectives and preferences\n",
    "* Identify target Smart Cities projects that align with municipality objectives, constraints, and preferences\n",
    "* Enable translation of municipality objectives and preferences to measurable utility\n",
    "* Produce a set of feasible technology solutions to a Smart City project proposal\n",
    "* Accurately evaluate overall effectiveness of technology solutions based on relating effectivness to cost\n",
    "* Accurately evaluate overall benefit of technology solutions based on relating benefit or utility to cost\n",
    "* Enable evaluation of Smart Cities technology projects based on overall utility gained"

    "# Concept of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA project will capture targeted inputs from a municipality to identify objectives, constraints, and preferences.  This information will define project requirements and begin to filter project evaluation criteria and available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this information a Cost-Effectiveness Analyis (CEA) is performed against the available options and target objectives.  This analysis will explore the relationship of system performance to system effectiveness.  It seeks to define the relative costs for varying levels of effectiveness towards the preferences and objectives set forth by the municipality.  Understanding the required levels of performance to make a system effective provides an initial baseline for solution alternative selection that is aligned with the constraints and objectives for a municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying objectives, and narrowing down the possible solution space based on the CEA, the next objective of the SCDA program is to provide a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).  The CBA attempts to define a monetary value for the measure of effectiveness defined against solution alternatives identified in the CEA.  The primary measures of effectiveness utilized by the SCDA program are _municipal revenue_ and _public perception_.   These measures are related to a cost through a series of models to define an overall measure of utility a muncipality can expect as a benefit for a target project and identified solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBA will include Risk Analysis (RA) models that identify cost impacts of risks associated for identified project and solution options.  The CBA will also include models that perform a full Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) for the expected Life Cycle of the project and solution options.  This additional rigor will ensure the identified project and solution options will provide benefit to the municipality throughout the life of the project, and not just focus on initial implementation benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of the CEA, CBA, RA, and LCCA is a final report that provides the municipality a quantitative comparison of available and feasible options that align with the objectives, constraints, and preferences of the municipality.  This information will be utilized to make objective determinations on project evaluation and selection based on solution options that provide the most overall benefit, or utility, to a municipality.\n",

    "### Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Much has been written about Smart Cities; what they are `[1][2][3][4][5]`, methods to evaluate Smart Cities cities `[7][8][9][10]`, methods to design smarter city projects `[5]` and case studies `[1]` of other cities.  Some example projects provided by Karadag [6] were reviewed during research for the SCDA program include the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lighting lamps renewed in Milan using LED\n",
    "* Danish Outdoor lighting Lab (DOLL)\n",
    "* Adelaide smart parking smart lighting \n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Atlanta is specifically looking at Smart Cities infrastructure projects that involve renewing existing public lighting infrastructure.  A similar infrastructure project occurred in Kansas City, MO `[16]`, which provides very specific cost and benefit analysis for LED lighting renewal projects.   Another project currently taking proposals is for the City of Chicago `[17]`.  The Request for Information (RFI) published by the City of Chicago provides information on many advanced use cases for Smart Cities project deployments.  Many of these use cases served as starting points for exploration into possible uses and benefits explored for the City of Atlanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are papers that present guidelines for Smart Cities projects and city planning.  One such papwer was produced by the European Union as a guide for the analysis of public investment projects `[11]`.  However, there is not currently a tool, method, or process to use for the evaluation and selection of Smart Cities projects.  There is strong research for how to implement specific technology solutions to Smart Cities project problems, but very little research in the area of optimizing decisions to determine the most appropriate Smart Cities infrastructure projects to pursue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help address the lack of research and tools available for decision making when planning for Smart Cities infrastructure projects, the SCDA program initiated a project to develop a SCDA tool.  The SCDA tool intends to utilize existing research on technology solutions and customer preferences to model potential deployment scenarios.   The model will provide a municipality with information necessary to evaluate an infrastructure based on modeld costs and benefits for the project.  A municipality can then make a more informed decision on which projects to target for further evaluation.  Additionaly the municipality will have a better understanding of the expected costs and benefits of a project for proper planning for and communication of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a useful model that can support decisions that will identify and direct Smart Cities infrastructure projects, a clear understanding of costs and benefits is required.  Data gathered from existing projects, trade studies, conference papers, and government organizations served as a basis for deriving parametric cost and benefit models to allow exploration of a design and trade space for specific technology solutions towards Smart Cities uses.  One paper that was pivotal in providing background research for cost and benefit model development was the paper by Hatcher et. al `[13]`.  The paper explores the costs and benefits of all known intelligent transportation systems implemented by municipalities up until 2014.  The paper was published by the US Department of Transportation Intelligent Transportation Systems JPO, and references an exhaustive database of specific project implementations that provide costs and benefits of the projects.   While transportation systems are not the only category of Smart Cities infrastructure projects, the research provided by this paper was invaluable to gathering adequate and accurate data for designing model equations for cost and benefit models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to exploring research relating to specific quantifiable costs and benefits, expressed in financial terms, the SCDA project explored less tangible measures for benefit models.  One area of exploration involved a Quality of Life (QoL) Index proposed by Mladen `[7]`.  The numbeo.com site started by Mladen provides a definition of measures that are used to evaluate different indices that relate to the QoL for a municipality.   The different indices combine to form an aggregate QoL Index.   The data used for the equations is generated from surveys that relate to the measures that define the indices.   This data is made available through APIs exposed on the numbeo.com site.  The QoL data and APIs were a critical resource for the SCDA project.  The data and services were utilized to define a QoL calculator that was used to evalate how specific Smart Cities infrastructure projects would impact the QoL index for a municipality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The QoL index provides an extra metric for project evaluation and allows municipalities, for the first time, to explore less tangible measures of success that may impact the perception and return of a Smart Cities project.  The SCDA project searched for research that would relate the QoL index to a financial unit of measure, so that it could be directly related to the other cost and benefit models utilized in the SCDA tool.  One paper by Albouy & Lue `[18]` suggests the existence of a \"willingness-to-pay\" index that relates to a QoL index and that where people live provides guidance as to what they are willing to pay for a specific QoL.  Another paper by Kuminoff et al `[19]` also suggest that people that reside close together have similar preferences and make similar value judgements towards items that contribute to QoL.  This paper alludes to neighborhoods with homes of common sizes and common ammenities could be used to undertand QoL and make decisions on how to judge effectiveness of public policy decisions.   However the paper stops short of providing a suggested financial reprentation of a QoL index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA project attempted to close the research gap and find a numerical relation of property and rent prices to QoL indexes for different cities in the US.  Data from numbeo.com `[7]` and zillow.com `[20]` were utilized separately to determine if any correlation could be found.  The details of this research are shown in the [Model Data](#Calculate-Financial-Impact-of-Quality-of-Life) research section, and unfortunately the data did not refelect a strong positive correlation between property values or rent prices (as defined by zillow.com and numbeo.com) and the QoL index (as defined by numbeo.com).  For the purpose of the initial version of the SCDA tool, the QoL metric is presented as an additional metric that is not directly related to a financial value.  Further research into how the QoL could be correlcated to a financial term is an area for future research."

    "|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "|Municipal Elected Leadership|Elected officials of a municipality|Main influence on project goals, evaluation, and ultimate project approval|\n",

    "|Employers|Employers that employ residents of a municipality and may reside within the municipality.|Projects that attract and retain employers will impact residents|\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation for all stakeholders can be reduced into financial and public perception benefits derived from any Smart Cities project.   The section below outlines the impacts and challenges each main stakeholder faces in pursuit of these stated objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Municipal Elected Leadership\n",
    "\n",
    "Elected leaders of a municipality are charged with optimizing the available financial resources of the municipality to provide the most benefit to constituents of the municipality.   The number and quality of services received by constituents impacts public perception of the leadership and the muncipality as a whole.   Higher public perception drives employer, resident, and visitor demand to engage with the municipality.   This engagement, at a high level, is what drives additional revenue for the municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a elected official is to effectively target available financial resources to provide low cost and effective services for constituents of the municipality.  A crucial impediment to this goal is the ability of an elected official to properly evaluate the cost, effectiveness, and overall benefit (utility) of a Smart Cities project proposal.  Currently tools are not available to consistently, and quantifiably provide project proposal evaluation and relate that evaluation to an overall stakeholder measure of utility."

    "## Capabilities Gaps and Overlaps or Redundancies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlaps and Redundancies\n",
    "\n",
    "Municipal governments attempt to evaluate Smart Cities project proposals through a combination of internal and contracting resources.   In many cases government policy mandates that external organizations must participate in large scale project proposal evaluation.  This external evaluation does attempt to understand, quantify, and measure benefit of Smart Cities project proposals.  However, the concern is that each external engagement is separate, and it is difficult to compare results of multiple external contractor engagements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Municipal governments do not have a consistent definition of an overall measure of utility for which to compare Smart Cities project proposals and evaluate their impact on the municipality.   Each project proposal from an external vendor will provide some defintion of cost.   However, this definition of cost is insufficient to compare proposals from several vendors and determine the proposal that provides the most benefit to the municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first gap with the vendor defined cost is that there is not a clear way to relate that cost to a measure of effectiveness of the solution.  The effectiveness of the solution directly relates to the objectives and preferences of the municipality, and translates to a financial benefit.   The measure of effectiveness of the solution must include all possible sources of benefit and be converted into financial terms to clearly define the overall benefit to the municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another gap with vendor defined cost is that it may not fully capture the constraints and risks encountered by the municipality.   Each muncipality will have unique constraints that are dictacted by regulatory policy or legal precedence.  Additionally, each muncipality with have a unique risk signature based on the political environment, financial stability, and available labor force for project implementation.  Without full evaluation of these unique constraints and risks, actual costs cannot be accurately evaluated for a proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, vendor defined cost may not fully evaluate and account for full Life Cycle Costs (LCC).   Most proposals attempt to provide an accurate reflection of installation costs, and the vendor attempts to compare those installation costs with a proposed benefit for the system after installation.   However, most costs for a new system are incurred in the utilization and support life cycle stages.   Furthermore, retirement costs after the usable life of the system has expired must be captured in the total cost calculation for a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently a municipal government does not have a consistent, quantifiable, and wholeistic perspective for evaluating the overall utility gained from a Smart Cities project proposal.  The ability of a municipality to properly evaluate cost is limited, and therefore the risk of negative public perception from failed or cost overrun projects is greatly increased. Additionally, the current benefit evaluation is incomplete.  These gaps lead to an inaccurate reflection of total utility derived from a technical solution, making project selection decisions extremely difficult and error prone for a municipality."

    "\n",
    "### Doctrine\n",
    "\n",
    "Project proposal evaluation by a government entity is inherently biased towards short term costs and rewards.  Budget cycles normally do not run more than one year, so many proposals are only evaluated based on initial costs and expected benefits within near-term budget cycles.  Additonally, the public perception and support for a project is generally driven by the ability to sell a vision of benefits to the constituents of a municipality, without clear empiracle evidence of these benefits. It is difficult to fully change this mindset without transpartent tools that provide quantifiable and comparable measures of total benefits for Smart Cities project proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to alter the organizational structure of a municipal government and potentially privatize some of the project evaluation and implementation tasks.  However, elected officials will still need to understand the overall costs and benefits of a project to make final decisions on budget allocations for projects.   Even with a change of organizational structure this fundamental decision point will not change, and therefore cannot be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training municipal governments may increase the ability to evaluate and implement specific Smart Cities technology products.  However, training does not address the identified capability gap of providing the ability to perform consistent and quantifiable cross product evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leadership\n",
    "\n",
    "Elected leadership is not an item that is directly controllable by any overseeing entity.  Public opinion will control the elected leadership, and each leadership team may have their own priorities and directives for the municipality.  The gap of providing a transparent measure of utility for an Smart Cities project proposals still exists from one leadership team to the next.  Additionally, it is important for each team to have common definitions of utility and benefit to provide consistent support and funding for projects with long implementation windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personnel\n",
    "\n",
    "Municipal entities are incentivized to optimize the use of available municipal funds.  The justifications and support for Smart Cities projects is difficult to quantify without some formal definition of utility and models that provide evaluations of expected utility for specific project options.   Without a tool to quantify benefit, it is difficult for the muncipal residents to hold the elected officials accountable, and it is difficult for the elected officials to convey the benefit derived from Smart Cities project investments.   The personnel involved in the process are not changing anytime soon, so insertion of a tool to help evaluate decisions and communicate benefit is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, one of the main drivers for municipal cost is for operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure.  Many Smart Cities projects aim to reduce this cost by reducing required personnel interactions.  It is possible to provide some cost savings by optimizing or limiting personnel use for infrastructure maintenance by improving policies and procedures.   This would provide some financial benefit, and possibly some public perception benefit, but it does not address the stated gaps in Smart Cities project evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Smart Cities projects, municipal facilities could relate to public works buildings, equipment utilized to maintain and support public assets, or physical public infrastructure.   It is possible to improve any and all of these items without implementing a Smart Cities technology project, but the general trend in the industry is to maximize capital investments and minimize maintenance costs through the use of Smart Cities technologies.  Without a tool to evaluate Smart Cities projects consistently, the benefit to public facilities costs is difficult to quantify."

    "The capability gap for muncipal governments is clear.   Currently municipal governments do not have an accurate way to evaluate the cost and benefit of trending Smart Cities projects.  Without the ability to consitently and accurately measure benefits of projects, qualitative and subjective evaluations tend to direct short term policy decisions, leading to sub-optimal outcomes for the finances of a municipality and decreased public perception of the municipality.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Closing this capability gap would provide consistent and quantifiable definitions of benefit (utility) for a specific Smart Cities project.   Allowing objective comparision across projects and across stakeholders is critical to closing the project evaluation gap.   The SCDA program suggests implementation of an advanced set of models and simulations with the SCDA tool will drastically reduce the identified capability gap and vastly improve the ability of municipalities to evaluate and implement Smart Cities projects."

    "First the customer objectives, constraints, and preferences are codified to understand the Smart City use cases that best align with these customer objectives and preferences.   These benefits are then evaluated in a priority matrix against the architecture evaluation criteria for sensors that support Smart Cities projects.  This evaluation provides a clear definition of the target benefits a customer is aiming to achieve with the Smart Cities project under evaluation, as well as an understanding as to which sensor evaluation criteria have the most impact on achieving these benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the target benefits are defined, a Technology Market Survey (TMS) is performed to understand possible tecnology solutions to achieve the defined benefit targets.   The first part of this process involves exploring commercially available technological solutions that could be used to achieve the target benefits for the Smart Cities project.  After a larger set of technology solutions are identified, these solutions are filtered through the creation of a Technology Impact Matrix (TIM) and a Technology Compatibility Matrix (TCM).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The TIM uses a prioritization matrix to evaluate each of the technology solutions against the sensor evaluation criteria, with more focus placed on the criteria deemed most impactful to achieving the benefits defined from evaluation of the customer objectives, constraints, and preferences.   The Technology Readiness Level is also uses as a weighting factor in the TIM evaluation.  The end result of this process is that the list of available technology options is now related to their impact on architectural effectiveness.   The solutions that show the highest potential for architectural effectiveness will carry forward for further evaluation.\n",

    "It is possible that multiple sensors are needed to achieve the target benefits for a Smart Cities project.   In this case it a TCM is created to evaluate compatibility of multiple technology solutions.   It may not be feasible to deploy the optimal combination of sensors defined in the TIM.  The result of this model will identify where technologies are imcompatible and alternate solutions are needed.  This could require new techology solutions to be evaluated, or it may constrain the deployment capabilities of the final system.  The goal is to understand the final technology options that are feasible and will achieve the benefit targers.   These solutions will carry forward into more detailed cost models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining feasible technology options undergo a risk analysis.   Each risk is identified and explored to understand the probability the risk will occur and the finacial impact of the risk.  This information is used to derive a risk associated cost for each of the technology options.\n",

    "Based on the technology options chosen, and the target benefits for the project, a collection of models are evaluated to understand an overall understanding of performance.   Each technology solution is capable of different performance levels.   A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) is performed to understand the cost associated with a particular common metric of performance for each technology solution.  This will become one of the primary metrics for final evaluation and optimization of the overall SCDA model of utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final piece of the SCDA model of utility is a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).  The CBA defines the overall benefit derived from a technology solution, as compared to the cost required to achieve that solution.   The overall cost includes all of the items discussed in the prior sections, as well as a cost derived from a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA).  In the LCCA, the cost associated with the 5 Systems Engineering Life Cycle stages (Concept, Development, Production, Utilization, Support, and Retirement) are estimated and evaluated.  A specific focus is placed on costs associated with Utilization, Support, and Retirement, as those stages are typically underserved by vendor evaluation and can represent the largest costs for a lare scale Smart Cities project.\n",

    "### Costs\n",

This information was largely derived from similar projects infrastructure projects delivering solutions that align with the use cases of advanced lighting, traffic, and crime.   Utilizing costs from existing projects provides a baseline for evaluation that supports an adequate level of evaluation for solution evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases it is not possible, or even feasible to provide highly accurate analytical cost models that accurately define every component of an unprecedented system.  To work around this problem heuristic models of existing projects were evaluated to understand relationships and measures that can be used to estimate cost.   These Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) are derived from parametric exploration of existing data to determine relations between design variables of a technology solution, and ultimate costs for delivering that solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric models derived from past projects should provide a level of accuracy that supports decision making to determine optimal technical solutions to target in pursuit of a target set of benefits.   Additional empirical cost models are recommended after a technology solution is identified and a project is initiated to realize that solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "Reviewing benefits of existing Smart City infrastructure projects, it is clear that benefits are separated into three main categories.  Each of the categories is described in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost Savings\n",
    "Cost savings are evaluated based on the existing state of a municipality.   If the municipality were to continue with operations as they are currently performed, there is a known operational cost.  This operational cost is the \"do-nothing\" cost.  This serves as the baseline for understanding cost savings of any new technology solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the cost model process defined above, any new technology solution is reviewed to determine the cost of operations utilizing the new system.   Cost models should include evaluation of the Life Cycle Costs (LCC), which includes installation, operation, maintenance, support, and retirement costs.   Cost models should also account for risk and uncertainty with the LCC cost models, to produce cost estimates that are more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the lifespan of the new system is utilized to determine a horizon for the system.   Costs for the new system are calculated and discounted over the lifespan.  The delta between the cost of the new system and the cost of operating the current system are compared to determine the total savings achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environmental Savings\n",
    "Environmental savings relate directly to environmental benefits provided by the new system.  Tying these benefits directly to financial terms is not trivial, which is part of the reason for separating the benefits into a separate category.   While it is clear that a reduction in Carbon Dioxide is beneficial to a municipality, the direct financial gains from such a reduction are difficult to quantify.  In some cases the benefit measured here can be relational to existing environmental measurements or ongoing reduction targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One area where environmental benefits can be measured financially is with a market based pollution regulation system.  In these systems a market value for a unit of pollution is derived based on regulatory limits and economic demand for activities that produce these pollutants.   If a Smart Cities infrastructure project reduces pollutants involved in a market based system, the financial impact is easily understood and should be viewed as a direct benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Perception\n",
    "Public perception is a critical benefit to public infrastructure projects, but measuring the benefit associated with positive public perception is extremely difficult.  If the public supports a project, and demand is generated to live or work in a city that provides advanced technology through public service, there are measurable financial benefits.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The method the SCDA program chose to utilize is a series of measures that equate to an overall quality of life index.  This quality of life index was created by Mladen at numbeo.com `[7]`.  Utilizing information on property values and rent prices as a reference, both Albouy & Lou `[18]` and Kuminoff et al `[19]` argued that people are willing to pay more for a higher quality of life.  The differences of property values and rent prices can be compared with the quality of life index in several cities.  This relationship provides a relationship between the two data points, and facilitates understanding quality of life in financial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA program utilizes the quality of life framework provided by numbeo.com to calculate quality of life.   The technology solutions evaluated will impact different measures that impact the quality of life calculation.   If quality of life can be expressed in financial terms, the impact on changes to quality of life can be modeled and expressed in the same terms as cost savings.   The SCDA program attempts to utilize this approach to capture as many possible benefits from technology solutions as possible.  This helps provide a more robust model, and a more complete cost-benefit analysis."

    "#### Cost Savings\n",
    "\n",
    "In most instances, the current method of performing a function is the baseline societal cost for supporting a function or a feature of a municipality.  For example, the current level of spending and effectiveness of operations of law enforcement for a municipality will result in a specific baseline level of crime.  This measure can be adjusted with process or technology changes aimed at reducing crime.  If crime is reduce, all the societal costs related to crime will also reduce.  These costs include, but are not limited to, legal personnel, lost productivity, insurance costs, and personal injury.   If crime is reduced it is logical to assume these other societal costs will also be reduced.   This reduction in societal costs from a known baseline is what the SCDA program refers to as the _Societal Benefit_.  This cost savings can be addressed as a benefit in the overall evaluation of how a technology deployment will provide benefit to a municipality.\n",

    "$${Societal\\_Benefit} = Cost_{base} - Cost_{new}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality of Life\n",
    "The measure defined above as _public perception_ attempts to measure the perspective and preferences of the public towards a Smart Cities project.  The underlying assumption is that people are willing to pay more for certain public benefits, and the larger the benefit the higher the public perception measure for that benefit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA program contents that Quality of Life (QoL) is a measure that can correlate to public perception.   If a public benefit increases the QoL for a municipality, there should be high public percpetion for the benefit.   By using QoL as a measurement for public perception, the SCDA program is able to quantify the meaning of public perception, and understand the impact of specific technology solutions towards target benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall QoL model used by the SCDA project is based on a QoL Index proposed by Mladen `[7]`.  The format of the QoL is to combine several indices that relate to life in a city, with each index made up of measurements and factors that try to define individual components to the QoL Index.   \n",

    "* Crime\n",
    "* Health\n",
    "* Pollution\n",

    "* Traffic\n",

    "Each of the indices is comprised of many different measures of effectiveness.  The technology solutions evaluated by the SCDA tool influences these measures, and in turn influence the indices and the final QoL Index.  These relations are shown in the index diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/Qol-Model.png \"Quality of Life Model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Each use case is evaluated to understand which QoL measures could be impacted by the technology solution utilized to address the use case.  Ranges of impact are defined for each input measure to the QoL calculations.  These ranges are defined as a distribution, and the distributions are derived by the SCDA project based on evaluation from the team and external research into the impact of similar projects.   This distribution sets the range of of impact possible for the specific technology solution proposed for a use case.  The actual impact of a solution for a use case is defined with the following equation. \n",

    "This distribution for the possible benefits to QoL measures serves as a Bayesian prior to further evaluation of models for a use case.   The overall model will evaluate financial benefits based on LCC, Risk Costs, and Cost Savings to define an overall utility for the use case.   The model will optimize the installation size and complexity based on the overall utility outcome.  The optimal utility or benefit from a cost perspective may not always align to the optimal benefit that could be delivered from a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal utility is expressed in financial terms, but the optimal benefit is defined as a scaler (0-1) in the model.  This benefit scaler represents a percentage benefit derived from a technology solution, when the overall utility from a cost perspective is optimized.   The scaler is utilized in the QoL calculation to update the Bayesian prior distribution to further refine the actual level of benefits derived from a technology solution against a use case for a specific QoL measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one measure that impacts the pollution index is _noise and light pollution_.  If implementing a more targeted and adjustable LED streetlight will impact noise an light pollution, the bayesian prior for this solution may reflect between a 2 and 8 percent improvement based on expert opinion and results of similar projects.  The expectation, or beliefe, is that the probabilistic distribution of the actual impact is between 2 and 8 percent improvement, with a median of a 5 percent improvement (representing the triangular distribution shown below)."

Each identified risk for a technology solution will have some understanding as to probability the risk will occur and impact if the risk does occur.

    "It is clear that the relationship of data from the study to the Atlanta population produces less benefit than the relation to Atlanta service calls.   The SCDA program determined that the more appropriate correlation is with service calls, because the most direct impact on the total reduction in response time should be more related to the number of service calls than to the total population in an area.   If a populations of two cities were exactly even, but one city had 10 times more service calls, the impact of a reduction in response times would have a much different outcome."

    "### Calculate Financial Impact of Quality of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "A data aggregration site called numbeo.com `[7]` provides aggregation of survey data for different cities around the world on different comparison indexes.  Each index is calculated based on the survey responses to different measures that relate to the index.  A select group of indexes are rolled up into an aggregate Quality of Life (QoL) measure.   The SCDA program utilized the framework and concepts provided by the numbeo.com indexes and QoL measure to equate QoL to a financial unit of measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA program found multiple studies that explored the relationship of some measure to the QoL for residents to the price those residents are willing to pay for housing.   The Albouy & Lou paper `[18]` defines a \"willingness-to-pay index\" based on rent prices that are associated with workplace location and overall commuting cost.   This index, the paper defines, is higher in areas where people have an overall higher QoL, and the QoL can be related back to rent prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kuminoff et. all [Policy Eval on Housing Markets ref] paper also explores the relationship of QoL to property and rent prices.  The paper attempts to show a relationship of preference between people that live in similar areas, because those people are willing to make similar choices on what to pay for a particular QoL, and they generally agree on the importance of measures that go into a QoL index.   This paper shows that preferences can be understood and estimated through housing choices.  Combined with the Albouy & Lou study, the SCDA program determined a relationship between QoL and property/rent price could be used to estimate the amount people are willing to pay for QoL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process followed to equate QoL to financial terms started with gathering data from all available cities across the US.  The cities included varied population, area, location, and socioeconomic status of residents.   The overall QoL metric was captured at each of these cities and compared with property and rent prices in those areas.   The data was plotted on a graph and linearly regressed to understand the correlation between the variables.  This equation was then used to determine the financial value of a particular QoL index score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA Model evaluates the current baseline QoL to the new proposed QoL index, after implementing certain Smart Cities technology solutions.  This change in QoL can be calculated into a change in property/rent prices people are willing to pay.   This change in financial terms is then associated with the amount of value a technical solution will bring to a city."

    "#### Data Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop the regression model, the first objective was to set a hypothesis.   The hypothesis we wanted to test was to determine if there was a direct correlation between property value or rent prices with a quality of life (QoL) measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the model we needed to pull data from a few different sources.  The first source was the numbeo.com site.  We utilized the available REST APIs to access the available data.   The data needed to be collected separately and then merged together in the format needed for exploration below.   Numbeo provided raw data for property and rent prices.  The data was varied by location of the structure owned or rented, and by the size of the structure by number of bedrooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another data set utilized in the regression modeling came from zillow.com `[20]`.   Zillow keeps a very detailed record of home sales, and they define their own value indices based on home sales and other factors.   The primary measure used from Zillow was the median home sales price, of which we captured monthly values per city, for the last year.   This data was an aggregate all types of homes Zillow tracks data against.\n",

    "What this problem identifies is that quality of life is a very complicated, and multifaceted problem.  Any model to understand quality of life will require a great deal of research and understanding of users and preferences.   This seems to be one of the main benefits of the Network Planning Units (NPUs) utilized in many cities.   The NPU attempts to aggregate people based on a set of preferences, and those preferences don't necessarily adhere to municipality boundaries.   \n",

    "The NPUs were set to more accurately reflect common preferences within a cluster of residents.  One explanation for the lack of fit for our quality of life models could be that the data is not granular enough, and overlaps too many NPUs.  This could obscure correlations that may be visibile at lower levels of abstraction. "

    "Once again the data does not support a strong positive correlation between purchasing power with rent an the QoL index.   The second source of data may not provide a result to support the initial hypothesis of a correlation between property or rent prices and the QoL index, but it does serve as validation of the findings from the first data set from Numbeo.   While not directly applicable to translating QoL into financial terms, it does provide evidence that our data sets are consistent and our research is valid.   It also leads to the conclusion that the QoL index is more complicated than initially assumed, and therefore it is logical to conclude that a high level of predictive correlation is not directly possible through one measure."

    "These results led us to the conclusion that the QoL index could not easily be translated into financial terms.   Most of the research reviewed that studied benefits of Smart Cities projects avoided defining benefits in quantitative currency values, and we speculate this is due to the complexity of that association.   The most comprehensive study of benefits reviewed, the ITS BCLL [reference], did not provide benefits in quantitative currency terms.   Instead it provided qualitative metrics of _improved_ or _reduced_, and quantitative metrics that stated percentage change for various measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the data does not support the ability for the SCDA project to translate a change in the QoL index into an impact in financial terms.   While there is evidence to support that people are willing to pay for an improvement in QoL, exactly how much they are willing to pay is not entirely clear, or it is difficult to understand the impact across a large grouping of population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach in the first iteration of the SCDA tool is to utilize the QoL index as a separate measure from the financial benefits calculated from the cost and benefit models.  The QoL is quantitative, in that it provides a number that can compare different cities.  It is also useful to compare the projected improvement to QoL for a specific technology solution addressing a Smart Cities use case.   If the model predicts an improvement in QoL, then the SCDA program feels confident that this will translate to higher levels of public perception, which is one of the stated goals for the City of Atlanta and most municipalities undergoing Smart Cities infrastructure projects."

    "A review of street lighting studies in the United States and the United Kingdom finds that crime decreased by 21% in areas with improved street lighting in comparison with similar areas that did not receive improvement. Specifically, in Atlanta the improved street lighting resulted in a decrease in robberies and burglaries, although the incidence increased in the control areas. Interestingly, nighttime crime increased considerably in both the lighted area and control area of Atlanta. The improved lighting in Kansas City reduced nighttime violent crimes such as robbery and assault, but not nighttime property crimes including larceny and motor vehicle theft `[54]`."

    "### Traffic (EVP) Data\n",
    "\n",
    "During our analysis of potential sensor packages and capabilities associated with improving the city of Atlanta’s traffic system, a number of useful studies helped to highlight some of the available technologies that are in current use, and could be available for the Smart Pole system.  The Intelligent Transportation Systems Benefits, Costs, and Lessons Learned Report by the U.S. Department of Transportation took a deep dive into strategies for advancing transportation safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability by integrating communication and information technology applications into the management and operation of the transportation system.  The specific section that dealt with traffic control, talked about management of traffic flow through busy cities by use of adaptive signal control technologies (ASCTs) to coordinate the control of traffic to decrease commute times and increase safety.  It was shown that this type of system deployed in New York City, resulted in a 10 percent decrease in travel times through Midtown, it also significantly reduced fuel consumption, emissions, and crashes.  This time reduction, although valuable to the general commuter, was difficult to correlate to a monetary cost savings to the public or even more to the city.  This in comparison to the large sticker price of the ASCTs, which have been estimated between \\$46,000 and \\$65,000 per intersection, made it difficult for cities to adopt this technology `[13]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar technology solution has been implemented for the control and safe navigation of emergency vehicles during their transit to and from response locations.  There have been a number of studies conducted in the area of emergency vehicle management and crash prevention due to transit altercations.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a report in April of 2014 that estimated over the past 20 year period, a total of 4,500 accidents involving ambulances, with 35% of them resulting in injury or fatality.  Similarly, the NHTSA conducted a study that found 31,000 accidents involving fire vehicles over a 10 year period, of which 49 of those accidents resulted in at least one fatality to an occupant `[11]`.  In a separate study, it was found that intersection altercations were the main factor for emergency vehicle wrecks, leading to 43 percent of all emergency vehicle crashes `[44]`.  This was the area we chose to model in the SCDA tool, because of the available data to compare systems costs and benefits provided by the implementation of an Emergency Vehicle Preemptive (EVP) system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit scope for this analysis, the SCDA project chose to constrain impacts to the property damage caused by a crash between an emergency vehicle and personal vehicle at an intersection.  Significant benefits could be shown for the use of the EVP system in preventing the loss of lives due to injury or death, but this correlation was determined to be out of scope for the first iteration of the SCDA tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of studies conducted in the area of Emergency Vehicle Preemptive (EVP) systems.  The systems in the study utilize a variety of technologies,  including light-based, infrared-based, sound-based, radio-based emitter/detector, and GPS-based technologies.  The main source of data utilized in the SCDA tool was collected from a Traffic Signal Preemption for Emergency Vehicles study, which identified benefits and costs associated with the implementation of the EVP system in three different test locations:  Fairfax County, Virginia; the City of Plano, Texas; and the City of St. Paul, Minnesota `[27]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The study found that when the EVP system was implemented in Plano, TX, EV intersection crashes were reduced from 2.3 EV crashes per year to one crash every five years (0.2 per year).  The average cost of these EVP type systems at four-way intersections ranged from \\$5,000 - \\$8,000 per intersection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical data from similar EVP installations was utilized to model costs and benefits of an EVP implementation in the City of Atlanta.  The results from other muncipalities was scaled to the City of Atlanta based on the average number of commuters expected on city streets.  A commuter population comparison by city (United Census Bureau) was utilized to scale statistical data for the SCDA tool."

    "During the early stages of the SCDA project the City of Atlanta expressed a desire to reduce crime rates in the area through technology implementations during a light pole upgrade process. After exploring possible uses and benefits that address crime, the tecnologies solutions of security cameras (CCTV) and gunshot detection systems were identified as trending in similar crime reduction initiatives around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Camera systems help deter criminals from committing criminal acts by reducing the “mystery” of who commits a crime within sight of a camera. More recently gunshot detection systems are used to automatically pinpoint location of a firearm discharge, in the effort to reduce violent crimes and homicides within cities.  Implementation of CCTV and gunshot detection systems would target reductions in the frequency of crime within the city and the cost associated with managing that crime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Becsi `[55]` crime is the number one public concern for Atlanta residents.  The results of a recent citizen survey, conducted by the City of Atlanta for the 2011 Comprehensive Development Plan Update, found Public Safety as the highest priority planning attribute for the City of Atlanta `[56]`.  These findings align with feedback provided directly from project representatives working for the City of Atlanta.

    "While evaluating crime statistics, it is useful to research other similar cities to understand as much information as possible to make more informed decisions.  While geography and other factors are different, downtown Baltimore and downtown Atlanta have enough similarities that it merits some careful comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baltimor has 3,927 residents, while Atlanta has 15,503 `[60]`.  The property crime rate for 2010 in Atlanta was 560.  In Baltimore the crime rate was 474.9 in 2010, while the US average was 276.4 during the same time `[61]`.  Baltimore imlemented a security camera system, and the similar crime rate makes a comparison on costs resulting from crime and benefits of security cameras a meaningful comparison.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific startup costs for the Baltimore CCTV project was \\$11414.58 for 480 cameras, and included changes to the infrastructure to accommodate electricity and networking, in addition to camera installation.  The costs to maintain the cameras and infrastructure were \\$538 per camera per year, and the cost for operations personnel was \\$1,176 per camera per year.  The total costs for 36 months were \\$8,060,000, or \\$224,000 per month.  The Downtown Baltimore impact analysis reported a significant change in crime, with a 24.85 percent decrease in total crime after camera installation.  Baltimore also reported a 22.72 percent decrease in violent crime, and a 31.97 to 34.58 percent drop in property crime `[58]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the representative data from teh Baltimore CCTV installation, a 25% reduction in property crime was selected as the proposed reduction in property crime for the CCTV benefits model.  The model will perform uncertainty analysis with this value to evaluate solutions over a range of possible reduction in crime.  However, this serves as a starting point for model development and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to realize the benefit of CCTV cameras and reduce crime in an urban area, a minimum camera density is suggested.  The minimum density is again based on effectiveness measures from other reference implementations.  In this case a minimum recommended of 53 cameras per square mile is suggested, based upon comparisons of camera density in two different areas evaluated in a study by La Vigne et al `[58]`.  Additionally, preferred installation densities are derived from the same study.  Based on the research by La Vigne et al [58], the preferred camera density is 400 cameras per square mile.  This density ratio aligns with the ratio of 50 cameras in 50 blocks used in the Baltimore study, further solidifying the correlation of Baltimore cost data as a predictor of benefits for the City of Atlanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values used to dervie cost models came from several different sources.  One source is a Hi-Tech Security Magazine article `[62]` that states unit costs for security cameras shoudl account for 30-50% of the overall install cost of a security camera system.   The article also states that 5-15% of the install cost is related installation of a surveillance program, while an additional 15-40% of installation cost is related to computers and storage required to operate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a specific camera model as an example, the JVC model H137U has a purchase price between \\$536.48 and \\$740.  The camera has an expected Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of 90,000 hours `[63]`, which translates to more than 10 years of constant usage `[64]`.   The cost information gathered for installation, operation, and maintenance costs were used as decicion variables for the SCDA tool cost models.   The cost and benefit models can be combined to help provide a clear picture of how much benefit a CCTV camera system will provide the City of Atlanta when the design varibles and installation configuration is optimized."

Based on the research derived from other installations, mentioned above, there is a level of installation density in which no additional benefit is derived.  Models used by the SCDA tool will account for this non-linear scaling of benefit, and appropriately constrain the deployment numbers to find an optimal solution.   The benefit scaler in the equations above is utilized by the SCDA tool to manage this constraint.\n",

Violent crime (murder, rape, assault, and robbery) costs totaled \\$137 per American in 2010 `[66]` and it is estimated that indirect costs from violent crimes are more than three times as great as the observable costs.  A 10 percent reduction in violent crimes nationally would generate savings of \\$20 billion annually; a 25 percent reduction would reap benefits estimated at $50 billion per year.

    "* Replacement of existing lights with high efficiency LEDs\n",
    "* Emergency Vehicle Preemptive (EVP) signaling\n",
    "* Crime monitoring and enforcement through cameras and sound sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "For each use case, planning tools were used to understand the customer preferences and technology impacts.  From this information, combined with research into similar projects and existing technologies, a technology solution was drafted.   For the purpose of evaluations in the SCDA tool, this level of abstraction for technology solution is intended.   Detailed technical analysis of technical solutions would create additional costs and add more time to project evaluation.  The SCDA tool is designed to help people make more informed decisions, early in project evaluation, when budget and time is not available for detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each use case is evaluated separately in the different model structures defined below, and an aggregate representation is collected to evaluate all use cases together.   As shown above in the model layers, the combination of different use cases is another layer of complexity that is not fully addressed in this iteration of the SCDA tool.   Most evaluation is assumed to aggregate directly, and complexities with true analytical evaluation of the impacts of aggregating separate technolgies is ignored for this version.   Future work will address higher levels of fidelity and explore how different combinations of technologies, at different scales, could impact the overall optimum solution.  For now this is a known risk and assumption of the overall SCDA tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "The overall model for the SCDA tool is broken into a series of cost and benefit models defined inside a Model Center [reference] project, and a QoL calculation model written in Java.   The execution of the QoL calculation model makes use of the _Quick Wrap_ feature of Model Center, which allows integration of the execution of the external QoL calculation application with the other cost and benefit models.   However, difficulties involved with accurately assigning common financial terms to a QoL index led to less fidelity in the model.  For this release of the SCDA tool the optimized utility from the cost and benefit models will stand as a separate measure with the QoL index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Latin Hypercube module in Model Center provides a mechanism to handle known uncertainties.   Known uncertainties are uncertainties that are known to exist, but the exact impact to the project is not known or easily calculated directly.  The Latin Hypercube algorithm allows distributions to be defined for each of the uncertainties, and the module will explore values within those distributions for evaluation in the model.   Each exectuion of the model may include 20-50 samples of uncertainty values from the Latin Hypercube module.  These random samples help more fully understand the impact of uncertainties and create more robust cost and benefit models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrogate models are also used in the Model Center project.   The QoL calculators are relatively expensive computationally, and therefore would require far more time and computing power than is practical for a full evaluation of all the decision variations utilized for model evaluation in the SCDA project.   To address this computation and time contstraint a surrogate model was developed to provide an approximation of the results of the actual QoL model, with a high level of certainty.   The QoL surrogate model for each use case has an $r^2$ value greater than 0.99, whice equates to a very accurate representation of the QoL calculation functions through the surrogate models.\n",

Uncertainties are also handled through uncertainty analysis using latin hypercube sampling on various decision variables, to make the model more robust to known uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main output of the cost and benefit models from Model Center is an overall _Societal Benefit_, as defined above.   This measure is represented as the overall benefit or utility of a technology solution for a use case.  Additionally, the optimized deployment solution is represented through a complexity/benefit scaler, as defined above.  This output value is utilized as an input parameter to the QoL calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main output of the QoL calculator is a baseline QoL index score and the QoL index score for each of the use cases.  Execution of the calculator utilizes the optized complexity/benefit scaler derived from the cost and benefit models to adjust the projected range of improvement for the different QoL measures, as defined above.   The specific benefit derived from a technology solution will impact the amount of increase shown in the QoL index for that solution by the QoL specific calculator.\n",
    "\n",

The reasoning behind this value is that in many cases a cost estimating relationship (CER) is that the level of benefit associated with a technology is related to the complexity of the technology solution.   Additional benefit is usually not free, as additional levels of performance will create additional complexity, and therefore require additional cost to achieve.   The Complexity/Benefit scaler attempts to capture this concept for use in adjusting the analytical benefit and cost models through this derived parametric relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties are defined as normal distributions, and they are expressed in financial terms.  A Latin Hypercube algorithm is used to evaluate normally distributed random values in the defined distribution to estimate cost and benefit uncertainties separately.  The optimizer also impacts this value by adjusting the average starting value of the distribution to further understand impacts and determine sensitivity to uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### QoL Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The QoL models also utilize the complexity/benefit scalers defined above, but in this context they can be referred too as straight benefit scalers.   As defined above in the measures section, optimizing the overall model on utility does not necessarily align directly with a QoL measure.   A cost/benefit model may determine the optimal utility is to deploy a 60 percent solution, but from a pure QoL benefits perspective the cost saved from a technology perspective means that a portion of the potential QoL benefit is forfeited by the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An area of future improvement is to more fully explore the QoL metric and determine how this metric can accurately relate to the cost/benefit models in financial terms.   The first iteration of the SCDA tool explored this option, but the scope of the problem required postoning full analysis to support project timelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [Model Implementation](#Model-Implementation) section above, the QoL Indices are made up of many different measures.   The individual indices then make up the overall QoL Index.   The QoL Model defines a triangular distribution representing the range of impact possible for each of the measures impacted by a technology solution.   The benefit scaler for that technology solution, or use case, will refine how much benefit is actually derived for the technology solution.  The actual distributions utilized are captured in configuration files for the QoL Model.  Each use case has a separate configuration file.  If a use case does not impact a particular measure, the baseline measure is utilized."

    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating preferences for the City of Atlanta, through a variety of means, a subset of use cases was derived for further review to illustrate the functionality and benefits of the SCDA tool.  The use cases of Lights (LED), Traffic (EVP), Crime (CCTV), and Crime (Gunshot) align with City of Atlanta preferences and provide robust examples of how complext technology solutions can be evaluated to make better and more informed Smart Cities infrastructure project decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While not inclusive of all possible use cases, the chosen sample use cases provide visibility into recommendations for further evaluation.  Results from the model provide the size of the optimal deployment for each use case to maximize _Societal Benefit_.  The model concludes that the lighting project, utilizing a LED technology solution, will provide benefit to the City of Atlanta through a reduction in _Society Cost_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Model results also indicate a Crime reduction project, utilizing CCTV camera technology, provides a substantial _Societal Benefit_.  The benefit is mainly attributed to the sharp reduction in costs assocated with crimes that are reduced through the use of this technology solution.   The CCTV cameras reduce incidences of property crime that reduce costs for victims, and they also reduce costs for law enforcement and judicial entities that process crimes.  The Gunshot detection technology does not reduce as many crimes as the CCTV cameras, but due to the cost of violent crime, the cost impact per crime reduced is much higher with the Gunshot detection technology solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Traffic use case evaluation for the Emergency Vehicle Preemption (EVP) system is inconclusive.  The current benefit model focuses on crash avoidance, because the reduction in response time is difficult to quantify into financial terms.   However, a reduction in response time could have a drastic impact on patient outcomes for ambulance service calls or property damage for fire service calls.   Additionally, capital expenses relating to new facilities or aging equipment could be avoided or reduced by allowing existing EMS stations to support a wider coverage area with the same response time, through reduced response times provided by an EMS system.  These additonal benefits do need to be tempered with the complexity of an EVP system deployment, but further research into additional benefits is merited before eliminating this technology solution."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The capability gaps around Smart Cities project evaluation for municipal governments is clear.  Municipal governments do not have an accurate way to evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of trending Smart Cities projects.  Without the ability to consistently and accurately measure beneﬁts of projects, qualitative and subjective evaluations tend to direct short term policy decisions, leading to sub-optimal outcomes for the ﬁnances of a municipality and decreased public perception of the municipality.  Closing this project evaluation capability gap will provide consistent and quantiﬁable deﬁnitions of beneﬁt (utility) for a speciﬁc Smart Cities project.  Enabling objective comparison across projects and across stakeholders is critical to closing the project evaluation gap.  The SCDA tool represents an implementation of advanced models and simulations with the express purpose of drastically reducing the identiﬁed capability gap, vastly improving the ability of municipalities to evaluate and implement Smart Cities projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA project has proven that through the use of the SCDA tool, municipalities have more applicable information available to make more informed decisions regarding Smart Cities infrastructure projects.  The SCDA tool provides analysis of possible use cases, and associated technology solutions, at a minimal cost.  Instead of performing detailed technical analysis of many solutions, eventually wasting time and money on infeasible solutions, the SCDA tool allows municipalities to quickly evaluate and filter potential projects and focus research investments on projects that align with preferences and show positive cost and benefit models based on the deployment scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "While further research can be performed to further improve the fidelity of all cost and benefit models, the logic to generate cost and benefit equations from existing project sources, and evaluate new projects based on the parametric cost and benefit models derived from this data very beneficial.  Municipalities can use this process to reduce costs around project evaluation, hopefully avoiding surprises and failures by making more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA tool also provides an exploration into correlating a QoL index into Smart Cities infrastructure project decisions.   Many projects may not seem like resounding financial successes during initial evaluation, but the projects are beneficial for the municipality due to the public perception created by the service provided and the increased demand for people and businesses that live and operate in the municipality.  The SCDA tool provides a mechanism for municipalities to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an infrastructure project on QoL for residents, and ultimately make more informed decisions."

    "\n",
    "The quality of life application was designed with 2 components.   One component was designed to extract data from various sources and transform the data into a common format to support model research.  The second component is the actual QoL calculator that is used by Model Center to calculate the QoL index for differet technology solutions to explore a trade space and optimize a final configuration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the application components are written in Groovy, and utilize a Gradle build and deployment framework.  The components are bundled under the same build framework and provided as an application bundle in the [Resources](#Resources) section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Execution targets are defined in the `build.gradle` file at the root of the application.   A `README.TXT` file is also provided in the application distribution bundle for assistance running the deployed application.  Class diagrams for each of the components are provided below.\n",

    "The qol calculator application is bundled as a binary distribution.  The application is executable from the command line using the gradle build script from the source code or from the binary distribution.  In most instances the source code is used for testing, and the binary distribution is used on a deployed server.   In the case of the SCDA tool, a version of this code was deployed to a Model Center server and the binary was executed through a Model Center wrapper script.  To execute the application from the root application source code folder:\n",

    "## Appendix 2 - SysML Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCDA project developed a SysML model to represent the domain in which the SCDA tool will operate.  One benefit this modeling approach provided the team is to better understand the entities in the domain that will impact operation of the SCDA tool.  The SysML model provides block diagrams of the major domain elements, including the Municipality, the Proposed System(s), and the SCDA modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the exploration of block relations in the domain for the SCDA tool, further exploration was performed into parametrics between the blocks.   This higher level parametric abstraction provided a basis for understanding the interactions between entities.   This level of modeling was more detailed than the methods used in the interrelation digraphs during concept exploration, but it was less detailed than the actual models derived and utilized within Model Center.  The parametric diagrams in the SysML model provided a framework, or rough design guidelines for the Model Center model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of the SysML model is requirements traceability.  The SysML model provided a mechanism to track and trace individual requirements to specific domain entities or parametric relationships between blocks.  This helped the SCDA project team validate the core requirements as design was progressing into the Model Center and extrenal application development phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the SysML model serves as a framework for understanding.  Additional research and work to refine the SCDA tool will provide higher levels of benefit to municipalities through greater accuracy and fidelity in the models.  The SysML model can serve as method to convey understanding to new team members, or future researchers, so they can build on the work produced by the SCDA project team as part of the first iteration of the SCDA tool.\n",
